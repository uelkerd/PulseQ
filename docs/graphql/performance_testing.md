# GraphQL Performance Testing

This guide covers performance testing strategies and best practices for GraphQL APIs using PulseQ.

## Overview

Performance testing is crucial for ensuring your GraphQL API meets performance requirements and provides a good user experience. PulseQ provides several tools and features to help you test and optimize your GraphQL API's performance.

## Key Performance Metrics

When testing GraphQL performance, consider the following metrics:

- **Query Execution Time**: Time taken to execute a query
- **Response Size**: Size of the response payload
- **Query Complexity**: Number of fields and depth of the query
- **Concurrent Requests**: Performance under load
- **Caching Effectiveness**: Impact of caching on performance

## Performance Testing Features

### Query Complexity Analysis

```python
from pulseq.graphql import GraphQLClient

client = GraphQLClient("https://api.example.com/graphql")

# Analyze query complexity
complexity = client.analyze_query_complexity("""
    query {
        users {
            id
            name
            posts {
                id
                title
                comments {
                    id
                    text
                }
            }
        }
    }
""")
print(f"Query complexity score: {complexity}")
```

### Response Time Measurement

```python
import time

def test_query_performance():
    start_time = time.time()
    response = client.execute_query("""
        query {
            users {
                id
                name
            }
        }
    """)
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert execution_time < 1.0  # Response time should be under 1 second
```

### Concurrent Request Testing

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def test_concurrent_requests():
    queries = [
        """
        query {
            users {
                id
                name
            }
        }
        """ for _ in range(10)
    ]

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        futures = [
            executor.submit(client.execute_query, query)
            for query in queries
        ]
        results = [f.result() for f in futures]

    assert all(r.status_code == 200 for r in results)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set Performance Baselines**

   - Establish acceptable performance thresholds
   - Monitor performance over time
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation

2. **Optimize Query Structure**

   - Minimize field selection
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement query complexity limits

3. **Leverage Caching**

   - Use response caching where appropriate
   - Implement query result caching
   - Consider persisted queries

4. **Monitor and Analyze**
   - Track performance metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize based on real usage patterns

## Performance Testing Scenarios

### Basic Performance Test

```python
def test_basic_performance():
    # Test simple query performance
    response = client.execute_query("""
        query {
            users {
                id
                name
            }
        }
    """)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.execution_time < 1.0
```

### Complex Query Performance

```python
def test_complex_query_performance():
    # Test performance of complex nested queries
    response = client.execute_query("""
        query {
            users {
                id
                name
                posts {
                    id
                    title
                    comments {
                        id
                        text
                        author {
                            id
                            name
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    """)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.execution_time < 2.0
```

### Rate Limiting Test

```python
def test_rate_limiting():
    # Test API rate limiting
    for _ in range(100):
        response = client.execute_query("""
            query {
                users {
                    id
                }
            }
        """)
        if response.status_code == 429:
            break
    else:
        assert False, "Rate limiting not enforced"
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Query Optimization**

   - Use field aliases to reduce response size
   - Implement query batching
   - Use fragments for reusable selections

2. **Caching Strategies**

   - Implement response caching
   - Use persisted queries
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Configure alerts for performance issues
   - Track performance trends

## Conclusion

Regular performance testing is essential for maintaining a high-quality GraphQL API. By following these guidelines and using PulseQ's performance testing features, you can ensure your API meets performance requirements and provides a great user experience.
